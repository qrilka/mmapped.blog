Hi there!
◊p{
  My name is Roman Kashitsyn.
  I'm a software engineer at DFINITY, where I have been working on orthogonal persistence, state snapshotting, state certification, state sync protocol, message routing, and much more.
  I have also co-authored a few heavily used canisters: registry, ledger, internet identity backend, and certified assets canister.

  Before DFINITY, I worked on large-scale distributed systems at Google.Shopping and Yandex.Maps.
